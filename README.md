# Looter - Visit real places with your mobile phone, collect loot and gain points in the game

Looter is an application made for an university project. Players sign up for events and then have to visit real places selected manually on a map or generated. When the app detects they are in position, they receive loot and gain points in an app. 

The app uses Google App Engine as a backend to store player data, pending events and active points. 

Looter may be similar to Pokemon GO and Ingress, although I made it a few months before Pokemon GO conquered the world, I didn't know what Ingress is then either ;). 

It is playable, although it would definitely need some work to make it commercial. However I decided not to continue the project after I had it rated at my university.
